## Hey I'm Derek! 

I'm a computer nerd who loves hiking in Glacier National Park (otherwise known as home), playing Pokemon (yes, I could beat you) and making music. Check me out on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/illegitimate-children) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/technicolor-horizon-ep/id694015064) if you like electronic music. I promise it's not dubstep.

## What I Actually Do Most of the Time

Data science is also my thing, so you can expect to see some posts about my recent work in the field. I'm super interested in computer vision, NLP and other forms of AI. I also love proving theorems and facts and sometimes just love a good integral (especially when it's in Probability Theory).
